This change in stance, indicating potential rate cuts, has led to a notable shift in market dynamics, with investors and forecasters adjusting their expectations for the upcoming year.
What Happened: During the recent Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, Jerome Powell, the Fed chairman, held interest rates steady, continuing the trend of the past three policy meetings.
Despite this, Powell's comments on potential inflation reversals and subsequent rate cuts have shifted the focus to the timing of these cuts in 2024.
As reported by Business Insider, the Fed's projections show a decrease in the expected end-of-2024 interest rates to 4.6%, down from 5.1% in September, hinting at multiple rate cuts next year.
There is a changing consensus on Wall Street, primarily driven by the Fed's tendency to lag in setting interest rate policy. This is due to officials relying heavily on delayed economic data to inform their rate decisions.

The prospect of a softer labor market could indeed fuel expectations of future interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, but it also raises concerns about weakening household demand, which could cast a shadow on corporate sales and earnings.
In this climate of uncertainty, investors are flocking to haven assets such as Treasuries and gold, while taking a more cautious stance on stocks.

In an online event in November, Al Jaber had reportedly remarked there was “no science” to support the idea that the reduction of the use of fossil fuels would help limit the global temperature increase to 1.5C — a key goal of climate change activists, and one of the central themes of COP28.
On Monday, day five of the climate summit, Al Jaber hit back, saying: “We very much believe and respect the science.”
He added: “I honestly think there is some confusion out there, and misrepresentation. I am quite surprised with the constant and repeated attempts to undermine the work of the COP28 presidency.”

Whether its goal is to be a force for good or, as the BBC recently revealed, serve ""as an opportunity to strike oil and gas deals"" remains unclear. 
Either way, the so-called “Conference of the Parties” says a lot more than what's coming from its climate talks: it's lending a view into geopolitics, political alliances, power friendships, and the fate of the oil sector.
Earlier this month, a report by the UN’s Environment Program warned that the emissions goals set during the landmark Paris Agreement of 2015 are not enough to keep global temperatures under the established limit of 1.5°C (2.7°F) below pre-industrial levels.
Current projections put the course of average temperatures at a catastrophic 2.9°C (5.2°F) rise above pre-industrial levels before 2100.
The UAE Paradox: The designation of Sultan Al Jaber as president of the climate conference has been a major source of controversy. After all, he is the CEO of the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company, a UAE state-owned oil company that ranks as the 12th largest producer in the world and 14th largest greenhouse gas polluter.
The BBC, citing leaked documents, reported this week that the UAE intends to use its role as host as a way to close fuel deals with 15 other nations.

Nations expressed renewed commitments to reduce their reliance on fossil fuels — deemed a moment of reckoning for oil companies.
COP28 President and UAE leader Sultan Al Jaber said at the opening plenary on Thursday: “Let history reflect the fact that this is the Presidency that made a bold choice to proactively engage with oil and gas companies. We had many hard discussions. Let me tell you, it wasn’t easy.”
Over the next 12 days, agendas are packed with seminars and discussions on decarbonizing industry, renewable energy, how new technologies will be leveraged to combat climate change and many other topics designed to send shivers down the spines of fossil fuel producers and their investors.
But in reality, will anything have changed for oil and gas-producing nations and companies after this event?

Here's how President Joe Biden could find himself having a conflict of interest in the latest battle.
What Happened: First introduced in 2015, the Apple Watch is a key product for the technology giant that has had several models and features released over the years.
The inclusion of blood oxygen-reading technology on Apple watches infringed on patents held by medical company Masimo Corporation (NASDAQ:MASI) according to a ruling by the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC).
The decision led to a ban of certain models of Apple Watches in the United States. Although the White House had the power to reverse this ban, U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai chose not to intervene. However, the ban was subsequently suspended by a federal appeals court, permitting Apple to resume selling these watches.

Nice Profits On Tactical Positions

Note the following:

The chart shows the market is in the resistance zone.
RSI on the chart shows that the market is neither overbought nor oversold.
The chart shows the Santa Claus rally is in full swing.
Sentiment is extremely positive. Prudent investors should take note, this is a contrary indicator. We previously wrote:

As we have been sharing with you, at extremely positive, sentiment is a contrary indicator. In plain English, sentiment at extremely positive is a sell signal. Here are the key points:


No one should act based only on sentiment.



Sentiment is an important indicator but only one of the many indicators that go into a comprehensive 360 degree analysis.



Sentiment is not a precise timing indicator.



If the stock market pulls back, sentiment may also pull back, and thus negate any negative implications.



 Market mechanics continue to be on the positive side.



When the calendar changes to the new year, the stock market can abruptly change.  We previously shared with you:

In The Arora Report analysis, the start of the new year will likely be the same as every other new year after a strong year for the stock market — if the stock market starts going down, everyone will jump on the selling bandwagon; if the stock market starts going up, everyone will buy.


There are nice profits on tactical positions. It is prudent before the year end to take partial profits on tactical positions or raise hedges or a combination of the two.  
Consider continuing to hold strategic positions.

The Munster co-founded firm was wrong about the timeline for Tesla, Inc.’s (NASDAQ:TSLA) Model 2, which is now referred to as robotaxi. As opposed to its previous estimate of 2024, the firm now sees a delay until 2025. 
Among those that fructified was the outperformance of the FAANG — the moniker for a group of mega-cap tech stocks.
Deepwater also called for:

Apple, Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) headset launch in late 2023
private-equity companies taking tech companies private
Unicorns going bankrupt
And Ford Motor Co.’s (NYSE:F) Lightning EV pickup truck outselling Tesla’s Cybertruck.

However, optimistic expectations of economic momentum carrying into the new year, fueled by anticipated Fed rate cuts and a soft-landing scenario, coupled with the traditional year-end buying trend, may help prevent a large-scale sell-off.
Cues From Tuesday's Trading:
The market exhibited strong gains on Tuesday after the extended weekend, with small-cap stocks taking the lead. Despite a brief dip into negative territory for the Dow Industrials in early trading, it swiftly recovered and remained in positive territory for the rest of the session.
The Nasdaq Composite and the broader S&P 500 Index showed strength throughout the session, extending their winning streak for a third consecutive day. Both indices closed at fresh two-year highs, and the S&P 500 approached its all-time high of 4,818.62 (intraday) reached on Jan. 4, 2022.
The Nasdaq Composite’s intraday peak stands at 16,212.23, achieved on Nov. 22, 2021, while the Dow Industrials are trading below their all-time high of 37,641.30 reached last week.
The all-time closing highs for the three indices are 4,796.56 (Jan. 3, 2022), 16,057.44 (Nov. 19, 2021), and 37,557.92 (Dec. 19, 2023), respectively.
Tuesday saw broad-based buying interest in the market, with energy, real estate, and utility stocks leading the gains.
In recent sessions, small-cap stocks, represented by the Russell 2,000 index, have outperformed their larger counterparts, settling at their highest level since April 2022 on Tuesday.
Describing the week’s performance as the calm before the storm, fund manager Louis Navellier stated, “This week is the last great buying opportunity for many stocks.” ...Full story available on Benzinga.com","['News', 'Equities', 'Futures', 'Previews', 'Top Stories', 'Economics', 'Federal Reserve', 'Pre-Market Outlook', 'Markets', 'Movers', 'Trading Ideas']"
