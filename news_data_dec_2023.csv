This change in stance, indicating potential rate cuts, has led to a notable shift in market dynamics, with investors and forecasters adjusting their expectations for the upcoming year.
What Happened: During the recent Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, Jerome Powell, the Fed chairman, held interest rates steady, continuing the trend of the past three policy meetings.
Despite this, Powell's comments on potential inflation reversals and subsequent rate cuts have shifted the focus to the timing of these cuts in 2024.
As reported by Business Insider, the Fed's projections show a decrease in the expected end-of-2024 interest rates to 4.6%, down from 5.1% in September, hinting at multiple rate cuts next year.
There is a changing consensus on Wall Street, primarily driven by the Fed's tendency to lag in setting interest rate policy. This is due to officials relying heavily on delayed economic data to inform their rate decisions.

Traders are grappling with mixed sentiments in the wake of weaker-than-expected ADP employment data from the previous month, hinting at a potential cooling in labor market conditions. This uncertainty looms large ahead of Friday’s eagerly anticipated jobs report.
The prospect of a softer labor market could indeed fuel expectations of future interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, but it also raises concerns about weakening household demand, which could cast a shadow on corporate sales and earnings.
In this climate of uncertainty, investors are flocking to haven assets such as Treasuries and gold, while taking a more cautious stance on stocks. 
The iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (NASDAQ:TLT), which tracks the performance of long-dated Treasury securities, surged by 1.4%, building on Tuesday’s impressive gain of 2.5%. 
On the flip side, oil prices tumbled, with West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude slipping below the $70 per barrel mark. This marks the lowest level seen since early July 2023, as traders continue to question the effectiveness of OPEC’s production cuts and grapple with growing concerns of a global economic slowdown.

In November, the private employment growth was 103,000 according to the ADP, below the 130,000 expected.
On Tuesday, job openings dropped from 9.35 million in September to 8.733 million in October, raising concerns among market participants about a continuing softening in labor market conditions.
The dollar settled at a steady level after initial gains in the early morning, while Treasury yields remained mostly unchanged. Oil prices continued to decline, with WTI trading at $71 per barrel, and gold edged up by 0.5% to $2,035 per ounce.

On Monday, day five of the climate summit, Al Jaber hit back, saying: “We very much believe and respect the science.”
He added: “I honestly think there is some confusion out there, and misrepresentation. I am quite surprised with the constant and repeated attempts to undermine the work of the COP28 presidency.”

Whether its goal is to be a force for good or, as the BBC recently revealed, serve ""as an opportunity to strike oil and gas deals"" remains unclear. 
Either way, the so-called “Conference of the Parties” says a lot more than what's coming from its climate talks: it's lending a view into geopolitics, political alliances, power friendships, and the fate of the oil sector.
Earlier this month, a report by the UN’s Environment Program warned that the emissions goals set during the landmark Paris Agreement of 2015 are not enough to keep global temperatures under the established limit of 1.5°C (2.7°F) below pre-industrial levels.
Current projections put the course of average temperatures at a catastrophic 2.9°C (5.2°F) rise above pre-industrial levels before 2100.
The UAE Paradox: The designation of Sultan Al Jaber as president of the climate conference has been a major source of controversy. After all, he is the CEO of the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company, a UAE state-owned oil company that ranks as the 12th largest producer in the world and 14th largest greenhouse gas polluter.
The BBC, citing leaked documents, reported this week that the UAE intends to use its role as host as a way to close fuel deals with 15 other nations.

The ban comes with a patent battle, a court appeal and more decisions to come.
Here's how President Joe Biden could find himself having a conflict of interest in the latest battle.
What Happened: First introduced in 2015, the Apple Watch is a key product for the technology giant that has had several models and features released over the years.
The inclusion of blood oxygen-reading technology on Apple watches infringed on patents held by medical company Masimo Corporation (NASDAQ:MASI) according to a ruling by the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC).
The decision led to a ban of certain models of Apple Watches in the United States. Although the White House had the power to reverse this ban, U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai chose not to intervene. However, the ban was subsequently suspended by a federal appeals court, permitting Apple to resume selling these watches.

Nice Profits On Tactical Positions

Note the following:

The chart shows the market is in the resistance zone.
RSI on the chart shows that the market is neither overbought nor oversold.
The chart shows the Santa Claus rally is in full swing.
Sentiment is extremely positive. Prudent investors should take note, this is a contrary indicator. We previously wrote:

As we have been sharing with you, at extremely positive, sentiment is a contrary indicator. In plain English, sentiment at extremely positive is a sell signal. Here are the key points:


No one should act based only on sentiment.



Sentiment is an important indicator but only one of the many indicators that go into a comprehensive 360 degree analysis.



Sentiment is not a precise timing indicator.



If the stock market pulls back, sentiment may also pull back, and thus negate any negative implications.



 Market mechanics continue to be on the positive side.



When the calendar changes to the new year, the stock market can abruptly change.  We previously shared with you:

In The Arora Report analysis, the start of the new year will likely be the same as every other new year after a strong year for the stock market — if the stock market starts going down, everyone will jump on the selling bandwagon; if the stock market starts going up, everyone will buy.


There are nice profits on tactical positions. It is prudent before the year end to take partial profits on tactical positions or raise hedges or a combination of the two.  
Consider continuing to hold strategic positions.

The Munster co-founded firm was wrong about the timeline for Tesla, Inc.’s (NASDAQ:TSLA) Model 2, which is now referred to as robotaxi. As opposed to its previous estimate of 2024, the firm now sees a delay until 2025. 
Among those that fructified was the outperformance of the FAANG — the moniker for a group of mega-cap tech stocks.
Deepwater also called for:

Apple, Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) headset launch in late 2023
private-equity companies taking tech companies private
Unicorns going bankrupt
And Ford Motor Co.’s (NYSE:F) Lightning EV pickup truck outselling Tesla’s Cybertruck.

However, optimistic expectations of economic momentum carrying into the new year, fueled by anticipated Fed rate cuts and a soft-landing scenario, coupled with the traditional year-end buying trend, may help prevent a large-scale sell-off.
Cues From Tuesday's Trading:
The market exhibited strong gains on Tuesday after the extended weekend, with small-cap stocks taking the lead. Despite a brief dip into negative territory for the Dow Industrials in early trading, it swiftly recovered and remained in positive territory for the rest of the session.
The Nasdaq Composite and the broader S&P 500 Index showed strength throughout the session, extending their winning streak for a third consecutive day. Both indices closed at fresh two-year highs, and the S&P 500 approached its all-time high of 4,818.62 (intraday) reached on Jan. 4, 2022.
The Nasdaq Composite’s intraday peak stands at 16,212.23, achieved on Nov. 22, 2021, while the Dow Industrials are trading below their all-time high of 37,641.30 reached last week.
The all-time closing highs for the three indices are 4,796.56 (Jan. 3, 2022), 16,057.44 (Nov. 19, 2021), and 37,557.92 (Dec. 19, 2023), respectively.
Tuesday saw broad-based buying interest in the market, with energy, real estate, and utility stocks leading the gains.
In recent sessions, small-cap stocks, represented by the Russell 2,000 index, have outperformed their larger counterparts, settling at their highest level since April 2022 on Tuesday.
Describing the week’s performance as the calm before the storm, fund manager Louis Navellier stated, “This week is the last great buying opportunity for many stocks.” ...Full story available on Benzinga.com","['News', 'Equities', 'Futures', 'Previews', 'Top Stories', 'Economics', 'Federal Reserve', 'Pre-Market Outlook', 'Markets', 'Movers', 'Trading Ideas']",AAPL

(NASDAQ:AAPL) increased its market value by nearly $1 trillion this year. However, according to analysts, sustaining such significant gains in 2024 may prove challenging.
What Happened: As per a report by Bloomberg, Apple’s journey in China is getting tougher due to government crackdowns on foreign-produced devices. Increased competition from Huawei Technologies Co. and a potential U.S. ban on its smartwatch business also pose threats.
Despite these hurdles, Apple’s stock increased by 50% this year, primarily driven by investor faith in the company’s ability to sustain high profits. Its current valuation, 29 times next year’s predicted profits, is almost twice its 10-year average.
Eric Clark of Accuvest Global Advisors pointed out that the most significant risk for such mega-caps like Apple is the potential rotation of money to other names. He explained that such companies might face higher valuations, slower growth, and tougher year-over-year comparisons, encouraging investors to seek other areas with potentially higher returns.

What Happened: The CEOs of both Warner Bros. Discovery and Paramount Global reportedly met Tuesday to discuss a potential combination.
A transaction would essentially create a streaming powerhouse, bringing the Max and Paramount+ platforms together. Other assets include several media brands, cable channels — including the CBS broadcast network — and sports media rights deals.
Here's a look at how analysts responded to the news:
Needham: The two studios could maximize value with a merger, Needham analyst Laura Martin said.
""Both companies have streaming assets that are sub-scale, but together their OTT bundle would be one of the largest,"" Martin said.
The combination would also make the combined entity one of the largest cable channel providers alongside the CBS broadcast network, which could lead to better negotiating leverage, Martin explained.
""Their combined film and TV libraries would have one of the largest content IP portfolios,"" she added.

Market Mechanics Surprise
Please click here for a chart of SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (ARCA:SPY) which represents the benchmark stock market index S&P 500 (SPX).
Note the following:

The chart shows a sell-off yesterday.
The chart shows the sell-off brought the stock market below the low band of the resistance zone.
The chart shows that this morning the stock market is rallying again in the early trade and is back to the low band of the resistance zone.
The chart shows that RSI was very overbought, and thus the stock market was vulnerable to a sell-off when a surprise occurred in market mechanics.
As we have been sharing with you, several market mechanics have been driving the stock market up. One of those market mechanics is 0DTE options. Everyday traders have been aggressively buying 0DTE calls. Everyday when the market started going up, market makers were forced to buy stocks to hedge the calls they had sold.
During the rally, market makers were more than happy to sell puts to investors as everyday puts expired worthless, resulting in market makers making huge profits. As the rally continued, market makers stopped hedging the puts they were selling. After all, there was no point in hedging because the stock market went up everyday.
In yesterday’s Afternoon Capsule, we shared with you that the Treasury auction was weak.
The weak Treasury auction caused the stock market to turn down. Market makers were caught flat footed as they had sold lots of puts without hedging. As the market went down, market makers were forced to sell stocks to hedge the puts they had sold.
The result of the surprise encountered by market makers was they were forced to sell stocks to hedge, causing the biggest sell-off since September.
The sell-off came just before the traditional Santa Claus rally.
Traditionally, the Santa Claus rally starts tomorrow.
The sell-off yesterday illustrates why it is so important for all investors to deeply understand market mechanics. Due to their very high value, Wall Street professionals keep the secrets of market mechanics close to the chest, making it difficult for most investors to understand market mechanics even when they try. To help you, we have made it easy for you to know, understand, and apply Wall Street’s best kept secrets. There are several podcasts in Arora Ambassador Club. You can join the exclusive Arora Ambassador Club by invitation only.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) has decided to suspend the sale of its latest smartwatch models, an action that could potentially cost the company up to $400 million.
What Happened: On Monday, Apple announced its plan to halt two of its Apple Watch models — the Series 9 and Ultra 2 versions — for US customers, starting Thursday online and Sunday in stores.
This suspension, a response to an October ruling from the International Trade Commission (ITC) over a patent dispute with Masimo, a medical technology company, is projected to impact Apple’s holiday sales by around $300-$400 million, according to Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives, reported Business Insider.
This figure, albeit a small fraction of the estimated $120 billion in sales for the October-December period, is a setback. The timing of this sales suspension, as Ives notes, “couldn’t have come at a worse possible time.”

Here's a look at the predictions and what investors need to know from Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives.  
AI Goes Mainstream: Artificial intelligence was one of the most talked about terms in 2023 thanks to a $10 billion investment in ChatGPT parent OpenAI by Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and the rising use cases. Ives thinks the growth of AI is just getting started.
""We believe AI is the biggest transformation in the tech sector in the last 30 years and is a ‘1995 Moment' not seen since the start of the internet in 1995,"" Ives said.
Ives said that artificial intelligence could make up 8% to 10% of IT budgets in 2024, which would be up from less than 1% of budgets in 2023. The AI sector could see over $1 trillion in spending over the next decade.
Apple Introduces the AI App Store: The app store from Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) has helped boost its services revenue over the years. Ives said that Apple may introduce its AI App Store at the Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in 2024, which will likely be held in June.
Ives said Apple’s services revenue could hit $5 billion annually once the new app store is introduced.
M&A Ramps in Big Tech: A prediction from Ives calls for mergers and acquisitions to happen in the technology sector, led by some of the biggest names.

The Pivot: This is the scenario in which the Fed says it believes it has done enough on interest rates increases with inflation back under control and changes its stance from mildly hawkish, to mildly dovish — thus cementing market expectations that rate cuts could come early in 2024.

CPI
Please click here for a chart of SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (ARCA:SPY) which represents the benchmark stock market index S&P 500 (SPX).
Note the following:

The chart shows that in the early trade this morning, the stock market broke above the top band of the mini resistance zone.
The chart shows that as of this writing the breakout appears to be failing.
Stock market bulls ran up the stock market Friday and yesterday in anticipation of lower inflation numbers.
This morning, before the release of CPI data, the momo crowd was aggressively buying stocks. This is inline with the momo crowd’s pattern. They buy ahead of key events hoping for better numbers. In contrast, smart money tends to not buy before an event because they understand there is risk if the numbers are worse than expected.
CPI came slightly worse than the consensus but significantly worse than the whisper numbers. Here are the details:

Headline CPI came at 0.1% vs. 0.0% consensus.
Core CPI came at 0.3% vs. 0.3% consensus.
However, it is important for prudent investors to note that whisper numbers flying around Friday and yesterday for Core CPI were 0.1%.  


The momo crowd bought immediately after the release of CPI, but smart money stepped in to sell the rally.
The consensus in the stock market now is that the Fed will cut interest rates five times in 2024, and the first cut will be in March.
Prudent investors should take the stock market consensus with a grain of salt. In The Arora Report analysis, the reasons are very simple.

0.3% core inflation is 3.6% annualized. The Fed’s target is 2%. The Fed is not about to change its target.  
Powell is very aware of Burns’s blunder and does not want to repeat it. Arthur Burns was perhaps the most intelligent Chairman of the Fed. He lowered interest rates when inflation came down, but then inflation came roaring back and he had to raise interest rates again. This is known as Burns’s blunder.


As an actionable item, the sum total of the foregoing is in ...Full story available on Benzinga.com","['Economics', 'Markets', 'Tech']",AAPL

The Fed’s Problem
Please click here for a chart of Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 (NASDAQ: QQQ).
Note the following:

The chart shows that the stock market has had a significant rally since the beginning of November.
The chart shows Arora buy signals.
The chart shows that the stock market is consolidating right at the low band of the resistance zone.
RSI shows that the stock market can go either way but the probability to the upside is higher.
CPI data will be released tomorrow at 8:30am ET, and PPI will be released on Wednesday at 8:30am ET. Both have the potential to move the stock market, but the market will really be waiting for the Fed.
The FOMC meeting starts tomorrow. The FOMC rate decision will be announced Wednesday at 2pm ET followed by Powell’s press conference at 2:30pm.
The Fed has a problem. In The Arora Report analysis, the rise in the stock market has considerably loosened financial conditions. Financial conditions have become significantly looser than the Fed likely wants at this time.
In The Arora Report analysis, the Fed needs to be very careful as the stock market is positioned to twist whatever the Fed and Powell say to move the runaway stock market train faster. Here is the key question for investors: Will the Fed be able to put the breaks on the runaway stock market train?
The primary driver behind the runup in the stock market is a group of three market mechanics. Historically, market rallies driven by these market mechanics at this time of the year take a pause or even have a slight pullback right about now, before another leg up.  The tentative plan is to use any pullback to buy. The more you understand about market mechanics, the more money you will extract from the markets. To help you, a new podcast titled “Market Mechanics Trump Mother Of All Reports – A Look Ahead” is in production.  The podcast will be in Arora Ambassador Club.

Apple’s Future Outlook:
Ives predicts Apple will become the first $4 trillion company, likely achieving this milestone by the end of 2024. This optimistic outlook stems from the anticipated pace of growth and monetization at the company in the coming year.
The analyst foresees a robust holiday season for Apple, projecting iPhone growth to outperform expectations in the December quarter. Strong upgrade activity in the U.S. and China is expected to contribute to this positive trend.

Goldilocks
Please click here for a chart of Germany’s DAX futures (NASDAQ: DAX).
Note the following:

Germany is the economic engine of Europe.
The chart shows a very strong stock rally in Germany.
RSI on the chart shows that after the strong rally, stocks have become overbought.

In The Arora Report analysis, consensus is building among investors that the European Central Bank (ECB) will cut rates six times by a quarter point each in 2024.  
In The Arora Report analysis, there is a high probability of ECB beginning rate cuts before the Fed.  
The newly released Automatic Data Processing Inc (NASDAQ: ADP) data supports a Goldilocks economy. ADP is the largest payroll processor in the country and uses its data to give an advanced glimpse of the jobs picture ahead of the official jobs report that will be released on Friday at 8:30am ET.

ADP employment change came at 103K vs. 127K consensus.


There is more good news for the stock market but not so much for working people.

Q3 Unit Labor Costs-Rev. came at -1.2% vs. -0.8% consensus. Unit labor costs going down is a big positive for the stock market.  


Productivity in the U.S. has taken a remarkable jump.

Q3 Productivity-Rev. came at 5.2% vs. 4.8% consensus.


The increase in productivity and the decline in unit labor costs are great news for the U.S. as a country and for the stock market. Expect gurus to spin this data as increased productivity due to artificial intelligence. Don’t fall for it. Artificial intelligence has not yet become pervasive in the U.S. economy. However, artificial intelligence will become pervasive over the coming seven years, and it will further boost productivity.  A fortune is to be made over the next seven years in artificial intelligence.

Many strategists are making calls to buy China as it is an opportunity to buy low. ZYX Emerging has covered China for 16 years continuously. The Arora Report ratings on China are currently suspended, but an opportunity to buy China may be near. Please stay tuned to the ZYX Emerging Real Time Feed by The Arora Report.
Moody’s is cutting China’s credit outlook to negative. This indicates that the risk of default by China has increased. Moody’s call has been triggered by the property sector crisis and local government debt. The largest property developer in China, Evergrande, took more than $300B, mostly from individuals, to buy properties but never built them. Evergrande is close to liquidation.

Making Money In Bitcoin
Please click here for a chart of Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC).
Note the following:

On Friday when bitcoin was trading around $38,000, we wrote:

Crypto bulls are hoping that whales will take advantage of low liquidity over the weekend and drive bitcoin above $40,000. A move above $40,000 will suck in more retail investors.


The Arora Report writing from Friday has now proven prescient. Whales took advantage of the low liquidity over the weekend to push bitcoin over $40,000. When bitcoin crossed $40,000, retail investors jumped in. Whales knew from the past behavior of retail investors that they would jump in after bitcoin crossed $40,000. This is exactly what happened. Retail investors jumped in, driving bitcoin to $42,000.
The chart shows when speculation about spot bitcoin ETF started. This was a trigger for this leg of the up move in bitcoin.
The chart shows the first resistance zone.
Now that whales have pushed bitcoin over $40,000, bitcoin promoters are pushing as hard as they can to bring in more retail investors to move bitcoin to the first resistance zone. Promoters’ pitch to retail investors is that there are trillions of dollars of institutional money waiting to invest in bitcoin. They give this as the reason for retail investors to aggressively buy now.
Prudent investors need to understand that whales and bitcoin promoters have an agenda. That agenda may not be in your best interest.
Bitcoin halving is coming early next year and that will also push bitcoin higher.
While bitcoin is moving higher, there are outflows from bitcoin exchanges worth more than $1B. On the surface, this seems negative, but this is a favorite technique of the whales to push bitcoin higher. Outflows from exchanges are promoted by bitcoin promoters as a commitment from investors to hold bitcoin for the long term.
Historically, outflows from exchanges have led to a rise in bitcoin.
There are three keys to making money in bitcoin:

Understand the behavior of whales
Understand that bitcoin has none of the benefits on a large scale that promoters have fed to investors
If a spot bitcoin is approved, it will lessen the ability of whales to run it up ...Full story available on Benzinga.com","['Cryptocurrency', 'Economics', 'Markets', 'Trading Ideas']",AAPL
